# SmartScheduler

SmartScheduler is a Python-based project implementing multiple CPU process scheduling algorithms. It allows you to simulate and analyze different scheduling techniques on real or synthetic datasets, helping understand their performance based on metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and response time.

## Features

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)  
- Shortest Job First (SJF)  
- Longest Job First (LJF)  
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)  
- Longest Remaining Time First (LRTF)  
- Round Robin (RR) with randomized time quantum  
- Priority Scheduling  
- Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)  

The project supports both reading real datasets (`.csv` files) and generating synthetic datasets with configurable parameters.
